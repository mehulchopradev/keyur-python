Object oriented programming (OOP)
    - Real world semantics to be visualized 'as is' in the software system

1. Real world actors ---- Data in the RAM
    - Data in the RAM : Objects
    - str, float, int, bool,... : All have been objects
    - Student, Professor, Library, Book, Author,.... : As objects in the RAM
    - class : A class gives a data type to an object
    - We can create 1 to n objects from a class
        - str, float, int, bool,.. : All built in classes in python

2. Real world actor characteristics --- Attributes of the object
    - Create an attribute in an object
        var.attribute_name = value
    - Get an attribute value from an object
        var.attribute_name

3. Real world actor actions --- Methods called on the object
    - var.methodCall()


Immutable object : An object whose attributes cannot be modified after the object
has been created
